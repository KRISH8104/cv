                A fidget spinner is a toy that has a ball bearing in the middle of a flat, multi-lobed (usually two or three) metal or plastic structure that spins along its axis when pressure is applied. <br>Despite the fact that comparable gadgets had been created as early as 1993, fidget spinners just recently become popular as toys.<br><br>
